A library for writing modern [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/)-compatible multimodal journey planning applications using [React]() and [Redux]().

## Running the Example

An example of an OTP-RR application is included in the repository. The example project is a single page application with a root entry point of the `example.js` file. This example.js file can be modified to suit the needs of a particular implementation.

To run, first clone the repo and install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if needed.

Copy `example-config.yml` to `config.yml`. Update `config.yml` with the needed API keys, and optionally, the OTP endpoint and initial map origin. (The default values are for a test server for Portland, OR.).

Install the dependencies and start a local instance using the following script:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Library Documentation

More coming soon...

As of version 2.0, otp-react-redux utilizes React's context API in a number of components. This changed the way that some components receive props such that they will not work properly unless wrapped with the context provider used in the `ResponsiveWebapp` component.
